### Question 1 

We will analyze some data from a famous case of alleged gender discrimination in admission to graduate programs at UC Berkeley in 1973. The three variables are `Admit` (Admitted, Rejected), `Gender` (Male, Female), and `Dept` (Departments A, B, C, D, E, F). First, create a dichotomous outcome variable $y$ that is 1 if Admit=="Admitted", 0 otherwise.

1a. (2 pts) Predict $y$ from Gender using a logistic regression. Is the effect significant? Interpret the effect: what is the odds ratio for admission to graduate school for women compared to men? Compute the predicted probability of admission for women and for men.

```{R}
adm<-read.csv("http://www.nathanielwoodward.com/admissions.csv")
library(lmtest)
library(dplyr)
data<- adm %>% transmute(X, Admit, Gender, Dept, y=as.numeric(Admit == "Admitted", Admit == "Rejected"))
fit<-glm(y~Gender,data=data,family=binomial(link="logit"))
coeftest(fit)
.44*1.84
.81/.44
exp(coef(fit))
predict(fit, newdata=data.frame(Gender="Female"), type = "response")
predict(fit, newdata=data.frame(Gender="Male"), type = "response")
```

1b. (2 pts) Now predict $y$ (admission) from Dept using a logistic regression. Interpret the overall pattern of results. For which departments are odds of admission higher than A? Which departments are the most selective? The least?

```{R}
fit1<-glm(y~Dept,data=data,family=binomial(link="logit"))
coeftest(fit1)
exp(coef(fit1))
```

*Department B is not signifcant because the p-value is greater than the alpha value. There are no departments with higher odds of admission than department A. Department F is the most selective and department B is the least selective.*

1c. (2 pts) Now rerun the model but add `Dept` (Department of graduate program) as a predictor. Interpret the coefficient for `Gender` now (note there is no interaction, so the effect doesn't depend on the level of `Dept`). Controlling for Department, is there a significant effect of Gender on admissions? What is the odds ratio? What can you say about departments A and B compared to the others (in terms of odds/probability of admission; relevel if need be)?

```{R}
fit2<-glm(y~Gender+Dept,data=data,family=binomial(link="logit"))
coeftest(fit2)
exp(coef(fit2))
```

*When controlling for department, there is no significant effect of gender on admissions. The odds ratio is 0.90. Departments A and B have much higher odds than the odds for departments C, D, E, and F meaning A and B are least selective than the others.*

1d. (2 pts) OK, now add the interaction of Gender and Department as you predict $y$ (admissions), to get a fuller picture. Compute the odds ratio for admission (Male vs. Female) in each department (A through F). Which departments favor Male applicants (i.e., higher odds of admission for Males)?

```{R}
fit3<-glm(y~Gender*Dept,data=data,family=binomial(link="logit"))
coeftest(fit3)
exp(coef(fit3))
0.349*2.30
0.349*3.24
0.349*2.64
0.349*3.50
0.349*2.37
```

*Departments C and E favor male applicants because their odds of admission for males is higher.*

1e. (2 pts) Take the admit dataset and, using dplyr functions, create a table with counts of applicants of each Gender in each Department (e.g., number of males who applied to department A) and also the percent of applicants admitted of each Gender in each Department. Sort descending by the count variable. In terms of selectivity, what kinds of departments did the majority of women apply to? What about the majority of men? Skim through the wikipedia article about Simpson's paradox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_paradox) to get a better idea of what is going on here!

```{R}
data %>% group_by(Dept, Gender) %>% summarize(mean(y), n=n()) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```


## Question 2

Load the starswars data (from the dplyr package). Remove all NAs from the variables `mass`, `height`, and `species`.  Create a binary numeric variable $y$: 1 if species is Human, 0 otherwise. Use this modified dataset for the remaining questions.

2a (3 pts) Predict the dichotomous Human indicator (`y`) from `height` using a logistic regression. Briefly interpret. Plot the ROC curve and compute the AUC. Create a plot of the logistic regression showing predicted probability of being Human by height. Color points by predicted human vs predicted not.

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
starwars1 <- starwars %>% drop_na(mass,height,species) %>% transmute(name,height,mass,hair_color,skin_color,eye_color,birth_year,gender,homeworld,species,films,vehicles,starships, y=as.numeric(ifelse(species == "Human", 1,0)))
fit4<-glm(y~height,data=starwars1,family=binomial(link="logit"))
coeftest(fit4)
exp(coef(fit4))
library(plotROC)
ROCplot<-ggplot(starwars1)+geom_roc(aes(d=y,m=height), n.cuts=0)
ROCplot
calc_auc(ROCplot)
prob<-predict(fit4, type = "response")
starwars1$y<-factor(starwars1$y,levels=c("1","0"))
ggplot(starwars1, aes(height,prob))+geom_point(aes(color=y),alpha=.5,size=3)+
 geom_rug(aes(color=y),alpha=.5,sides="right")
```

*Height is not a good indicator of determining whether a species is human (1) or other (0).*

2b. (2 pts) Predict the Human indicator variable (`y`) from `height` and `mass` (no interaction). Discuss the output briefly (you do not have to interpret any coeficients). Compute Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity. Plot the ROC curve and compute the AUC.

```{R}
fit5<-glm(y~height+mass,data=starwars1,family="binomial")
coeftest(fit5)
prob1<-predict(fit5,type="response") 
pred<-ifelse(prob1>.5,1,0)
table(truth=starwars1$y, prediction=pred)%>%addmargins
starwars1 <- starwars %>% drop_na(mass,height,species) %>% transmute(name,height,mass,hair_color,skin_color,eye_color,birth_year,gender,homeworld,species,films,vehicles,starships, y=as.numeric(ifelse(species == "Human", 1,0)))
ROCplot1<-ggplot(starwars1)+geom_roc(aes(d=y,m=prob1), n.cuts=0)
ROCplot1
calc_auc(ROCplot1)
```

*Height and mass are not good indicators of determining whether a species is human or other.*

2c. (3 pts) Predict this variable from the interaction of height and mass. Be sure to center your variables first, and save them to the starwars dataset as `mass_c` and `height_c`. Discuss the output. Compute Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity. Plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC. Compare the AUC with that of the main-effects model in 2b.

```{R}
starwars1 <- starwars1 %>% mutate("height_c" = scale(starwars1$height, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)) %>% mutate("mass_c" = scale(starwars1$mass, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE))
fit6<-glm(y~height_c*mass_c,data=starwars1,family="binomial")
coeftest(fit6)
exp(coef(fit6))
prob2<-predict(fit6,type="response") 
pred1<-ifelse(prob2>.5,1,0)
table(truth=starwars1$y, prediction=pred1)%>%addmargins
ACC <- (11+16)/58
TPR <- 16/22
TNR <- 11/36
starwars1 <- starwars %>% drop_na(mass,height,species) %>% transmute(name,height,mass,hair_color,skin_color,eye_color,birth_year,gender,homeworld,species,films,vehicles,starships, y=as.numeric(ifelse(species == "Human", 1,0)))
ROCplot2<-ggplot(starwars1)+geom_roc(aes(d=y,m=prob2), n.cuts=0)
ROCplot2
calc_auc(ROCplot2)
```

*The interaction between mass and height is significant. The AUC for the interaction between mass and height was lower than the AUC in part 2b meaning the probability was not as good as the probability for 2b.*

2d. (2 pts) We want to visualize the interaction, but it is continuous! We can get around this by setting mass_c to the mean (0) and plus/minus one standard deviation and then looking at the effect of height on the probability of being human. Below, in the code given, I take the starwars dataset and I duplicate it three times: to one, I add a column with `mass_c=0`, to another, I add `mass_c=sd(mass)`, and to the third I add `mass_c=-sd(mass)`. I stack them all on top of each other and add a label (`mass_cat`). Use this new dataset and `predict(..., newdata=starwars_new, type="response")` to get predicted probabilities from your interaction model, and then use ggplot to plot those predicted probabilities against height (use geom_line and set `color=mass_cat`). What do you see?

```{R}
## Code to get you started on 2d
starwars_new<-bind_rows(mutate(starwars1,mass_c=0),
                     mutate(starwars1,mass_c=sd(mass)),
                     mutate(starwars1,mass_c=-sd(mass)))

starwars_new<-starwars_new%>%
  mutate(mass_cat=c(rep("mean",nrow(starwars1)),
                    rep("mean+1sd",nrow(starwars1)),
                    rep("mean-1sd",nrow(starwars1))))
fit7<-glm(y~height,data=starwars_new,family="binomial")
prob3<-predict(fit7, newdata=starwars_new, type="response")
ggplot(starwars_new, aes(prob3,height))+geom_line(aes(color=mass_cat))
```
